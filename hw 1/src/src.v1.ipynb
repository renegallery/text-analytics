      "My name is Kapil Bhatt and I did my undergrad in Computer Science from India. I graduated in 2012 and after that I worked as an analytics consultant for 3 years mostly in the healthcare industry. My experience as an analytics consultant exposed me to the power of analytics and how actionable insights are extracted from the data deluge and how they help in decision making. Having gained concepts of descriptive analytics, exploratory data analysis, data visualisation by working with my clients and knowing my strengths around this field, I wanted to substantiate my skills with some of the advanced analytics concepts such as Machine Learning, Text mining, Optimization techniques, Predictive analytics, etc. and that is why I joined the MSiA program. This past summer I worked at Genentech, a biotech company and my project was to predict whether an early breast cancer patient will get an excision surgery. What got me interested in the text analytics class was my inability to use the EMR data to build features for the predictive model. I wanted to use the EMR data which consisted of text from the physician diagnosis of the patient and create features out of the diagnosis. I want to learn concepts of NLP so that I can deal with text data. My plans for the future are to remain in the healthcare industry as a data scientist.\r\n",

I like to program, but I don?t want to only program.  I like to research and write, but I need variety.  Data Science affords a great deal of variety for both context and work conducted, which I enjoy.\r\n",

      "Before MSiA I was a financial analyst in various capacities.  The dullest job I ever had, where I had it for a day, was inputting data into systems from mutual fund filings.  The most exciting job I had was trading futures contracts.  However, I felt limited using the classic financial tools and models and branched-out my interests to related by distinct studies.  Pivoting my career has been exciting and often anxiety inducing.\r\n",

I decided to join the MSiA after working as a consultant in the Bay Area.  A number of my clients were exploring applications of advanced analytics, in marketing, HR, finance, etc., and I spent time researching how other companies were using machine learning.  I realized that the field of data science and advanced analytics was rapidly evolving and the possible applications growing commensurately.  My goal when I joined NU was to develop the requisite technical skills to deploy machine learning models as needed to solve business problems and enhance my value as a consultant.\r\n",

Our team used LDA to segment risk-related news articles in subcategories, as well as all the requisite pre-processing to clean articles and generate the TF-IDF matrix.  Though a useful introduction, I would say my understanding of text analytics is still in early stages. \r\n",

I saw the field as a space where I could apply my thinking analytically and creatively to solve interesting problems that, hopefully, impacted others every day. Because of this, I still keep visualization in mind and preach it as one of the most important disciplines in the field.

Despite the obvious desire to learn how to extract useful information from data generated by human beings, for human beings, on a large scale, I believe unique opportunities exist for combining text data with visualization and machine learning approaches that could be worthwhile to explore. Do not mistaken this idea with word clouds, which are silly and terrible. I merely think information gleaned from text analysis could be applied interestingly in visualization, especially in an installation art setting. This could also be taken further by applying predictive modeling to text data, and then visualizing those results in some way, preferably interactive.\r\n",

After graduation, I was so ready to get out of the hot, humid, bug-filled, retirement state of Florida, where NOTHING happens and there was no future for me. I moved to Washington, D.C. and took a position with LivingSocial as a Business Intelligence Analyst where I worked with the company?s data sets to answer business questions from around the organization. After two years there, I moved to Denver, CO to work as a Technical Account Manager for an Adtech company. After some time in that position, I realized I really wanted to focus on Analytics, but I didn?t want to be limited to just the descriptive work I was doing in my previous position at LivingSocial, so sought out a graduate program where I could learn all the cutting edge tools and techniques for Data Science and was happy to land in the MSiA program!\r\n",

I?m also starting to interview with companies who are looking to automate a lot of their processes using text analytics. Text analytics really seems to be a separate beast from the analytics tools we?ve learned so far. And for this reason, it also seems that a lot people in the analytics world don?t know much about it, so I feel that taking this course could prepare me well and give me a competitive advantage in the business world.\r\n",

I became interested in MSiA because I knew I wanted to further my skills with numbers before entering the workforce and wanted to go to a good school in the Chicagoland area. I applied to University of Chicago?s statistics program and Northwestern?s analytics program (among others) but ultimately decided on MSiA because of the strong focus on practical skills and help with employment and internship opportunities. I have known for many years that I love to work with data and see what answers I can find from it, but my undergrad didn?t offer me the opportunity to fully develop those skills so a master?s degree seemed like the natural next step. Throughout my time in college I had the opportunity to work on a few different statistics projects that confirmed that desire. I entered into MSiA directly from undergrad. I spent the summer between undergrad and MSiA babysitting my adorable nephew. I became interested in text analytics as I discovered it was a field I could learn more about. I find the natural challenges it presents to be a fun puzzle to try to solve and also the ability to successfully use text analytics an increasingly important skill as there is so much data out there. I am excited to be able to learn more about what is possible to do with text as I am ignorant about a lot of methods.

I came to the states when I was in high school and has been here ever since. I majored in Econ and Applied Math during my undergrad. My internship during junior year of undergrad was related to retention analysis (although I didn't know the term retention analysis back then) and modeling. I got really interested in this whole data analysis field because of this experience. However, during this internship, I also realized that I could do much more if I had more statistically/technical/business knowledge, and that's why I decided to continue to pursue an education in this subject matter. In addition, at the time of my graduation, big data seemed like the most popular field of study, and it fits my academic background as well. I happened to know this program purely by chance through an alumnus, it was a last minute add to my application list. I don?t have any full-time working experience and came here straight from undergrad. I first became interested in text analytics during the first quarter, where we did a project with a retail store. One of the data columns we had was customers? comments. We did some kind of basic sentiment analysis, but I think especially for analyzing sales data, customers? opinion could have greatly improved our analysis if we had been able to analyze the text better. I interned in the Bay Area for the last summer and I really liked it there, I also got a chance to visit Seattle, which is a fun place as well, so after graduation, I would like to try to get a job in either places and move there. I went back to China for about two weeks just before school started, and I think there?s a fast growing market of data science in China as well, so I would like to explore the opportunities back in China as well.\r\n",

I quit my job and moved to the Philippines. I spent five months volunteering for a non-profit that provides housing for the poor and serves as an incubator for agricultural focused social enterprises. After the Philippines, I traveled to twelve countries in South East Asia, South America, and Central America. In this time, I received my yoga teacher certification, hiked to Machu Picchu, and went scuba diving in the Blue Hole in Belize. Upon returning from abroad, I negotiated a one-year Workday consulting contract with Allergan Pharmaceuticals, a previous client of mine from Deloitte. At the same time, I worked in the Operations department at Evolve, a start-up in the vacation rental industry. At this point, I knew the demand for data scientists was growing due to advancements in technology and the mass amounts of available data. I wanted to pursue a career in which I could use data to solve business and human challenges but knew I needed to go back to school to gain the technical skills to be successful in the field. Thus, I applied and joined the MSIA program at Northwestern. This past summer I interned at Amazon and developed a model to predict revenue potential of new sellers on Amazon?s third party marketplace. There were mass amounts of unstructured data available in the online marketplace; however, I did not have the skills to effectively incorporate this data. Therefore, I enrolled in Text Analytics to improve my skills in Python and ability to successfully clean and analyze text.

Before coming to Northwestern, I attended the University of Virginia and received degrees in Computer Science and Systems Engineering. I also spent a little over a year working as an undergraduate researcher helping with projects related to cyber-physical systems and unmanned aerial vehicles. The decision to pursue an analytics degree had its roots in a course in my third year of undergrad. In one course, we were given excerpts of real data sets accompanied by case studies from real companies. In hindsight, many of these case studies could have been solved fairly trivially by applying a simple logistic regression, but at the time our working knowledge of probability and statistics consisted of two intro courses. Being forced to creatively apply simple techniques such as simulation and hypothesis testing was one of the most fun experiences I had in a class until that point. During my last year of undergrad, I managed to get into an introductory machine learning course taught by a new faculty member. It was at this point that I realized the sheer breadth of applications in the field of analytics and data science, which motivated me to apply for the MSiA program. \r\n",

      "The broad objective of my first project at Xoanon was to provide user market segments in Nigeria for a multinational telecommunication network provider. The areas to be analyzed were- reasons for usage of multiple SIMs by a single user and percentage of such users,  the quality of the service being provided in comparison to the price paid, etc.  My responsibilities included working with Oracle SQL databases to retrieve raw data from call data records. For ETL and Data Integration I used Talend, whereas for visualization and pattern recognition I made use of Tableau. The combination of customer registration data, call data records and results from market surveys were used to arrive at the final segment model. After my training, I supervised the recruitment of fresh talent for a company, started by my employer, in the Internet of Things domain.\r\n",

      "Working in a startup enabled me to gain a broad understanding of Analytics. I decided to pursue my Masters in Analytics at Northwestern University to attain deeper knowledge and master the skills required to perform data analysis. I got interested in Text Analytics when I came across a lot of projects in the Teradata Aster Hackathon but I couldn?t attempt them as I did not know enough, and this class is an opportunity for me to learn more. I aim to leverage my skills and use the power of analytics for data driven decision making that not only empowers businesses by improving efficiency, providing strategic direction, reducing costs but also enhances the value of products for consumers and at a macro level impacts the minds of people all around the world.\r\n",

      "I am from Walnut, California. During undergrad, I realized that I really enjoyed investigative work and researching. I was first introduced to data analysis in my econometrics course. We were working on the NLSY97 dataset from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We found that married men with children typically had higher salaries than those who did not have children and were not married. I thought this was really cool! Not particularly the bias in hiring, but the fact that data analysis can reveal and highlight important information about people and society. So I signed up for more math courses during my final years of undergrad; it was unfortunately too late to major in math. As graduation loomed, I had growing pressures to become a functioning asset to our economy. I had done a couple of projects and internships at this point with no clear direction. I decided that a career in data and analytics could be a good fit for me, but I needed to learn more and develop my skillsets further, or no one would hire me. That is why I applied to graduate programs in analytics and data science. I decided to come to Northwestern instead of other programs because the curriculum is broad and diverse with a heavy focus on application. Hands-on-experience was a must for me because I came from a liberal arts background. Furthermore, the program seemed to be the most established since all the programs are relatively new.\r\n",

      "I became interested in text analytics during a project during undergrad. My team and I were moved by the black lives matter movement and wanted to figure out what people were saying, what they thought about, and whether the opinions were formed in geographic or demographic pockets. Why was there indifference and resistance to the cause? We decided to tap into the Twitter API to quickly get a sense of what people were saying. None of us had any experience with text, beyond grep like text searches, so we took the easy way out and just looked at the trending topics every day in large cities across the US. If I had known more about text analytics and sentiment analysis, our project could have been much more interesting. I don?t have specific plans in the future but I do know that I want to continue learning about analytics and use it to provide value to organizations and humanity.\r\n",

      "My name is Jan from Germany. Having been born in East Germany, my family moved to West Germany in the early 90?s. This is also where I went to elementary school and high school. While pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics, it was important for me to gain knowledge and insights in both business and IT and not to specialize in one or the other, as I believe this to be indispensable for somebody who wants to become a leader in the IT industry. During my studies, I first focused on analyzing and managing business processes, especially in marketing and sales. I applied this knowledge from the very beginning of my studies as member, and later sales leader, of a student-run non-profit organization which enables international exchange for students around the globe. A couple of years ago, I started getting interested in Analytics, having studied something in a similar area in my undergraduate degree. I did extensive research for schools that offered programs like data science or analytics and shortlisted a couple of universities that offered such programs. Northwestern ended up being my first choice, because it has a great program and it isn?t as young as most of the others. Before this program, I was working at a startup that created governance, risk, and compliance solutions in the financial services industry. The article about data scientist being the sexiest job of the 21st century and the report on Big Data of the McKinsey Global Institute were among the first that made me interested in the area of predictive analytics. As for text analytics, I am very interested in music with a lot of lyrics, which mostly means Rap and Hip-Hop music. I?ll be happy to learn how to use text analytics to analyze song lyrics. In the future, after graduation, I plan on working as a data science consultant and move to a new city.\r\n",

I built a model predicting how much the insurer would pay on commercial bodily injury claims. For each claim, I was provided with a full copy of claims handlers? notes on information about the accident. A data scientist at the company had written Python code that derives features from stems in the text data. While many of the derived features were highly predictive, I saw some areas for improvement. First, the code does not correct for spelling errors. Spelling errors are common because the claims handlers? notes are for internal use only; they are never published. Second, the code does not normalize common insurance terms, so ?attorney? and its frequent abbreviation ?atty? are treated differently.\r\n",

      "I was born in Miami, Florida and moved to Denver, Colorado when I was ten. I graduated from University of Michigan in 2011 with a major in Economics and minor in Mathematics. After graduation, I worked as a Consultant at Deloitte implementing Workday, a software as a service solution for human resource management. After two years at Deloitte. I quit my job and moved to the Philippines. I spent five months volunteering for a non-profit that provides housing for the poor and serves as an incubator for agricultural focused social enterprises. After the Philippines, I traveled to twelve countries in South East Asia, South America, and Central America. In this time, I received my yoga teacher certification, hiked to Machu Picchu, and went scuba diving in the Blue Hole in Belize. Upon returning from abroad, I negotiated a one-year Workday consulting contract with Allergan Pharmaceuticals, a previous client of mine from Deloitte. At the same time, I worked in the Operations department at Evolve, a start-up in the vacation rental industry. At this point, I knew the demand for data scientists was growing due to advancements in technology and the mass amounts of available data. I wanted to pursue a career in which I could use data to solve business and human challenges but knew I needed to go back to school to gain the technical skills to be successful in the field. Thus, I applied and joined the MSIA program at Northwestern. This past summer I interned at Amazon and developed a model to predict revenue potential of new sellers on Amazon?s third party marketplace. There were mass amounts of unstructured data available in the online marketplace; however, I did not have the skills to effectively incorporate this data. Therefore, I enrolled in Text Analytics to improve my skills in Python and ability to successfully clean and analyze text. I am planning to move back to Denver after graduation and am in the process of searching for a job there. I do not have a specific industry in mind, but I would like to work for a company with a small but growing analytics department.\r\n",

Before coming to Northwestern, I attended the University of Virginia and received degrees in Computer Science and Systems Engineering. I also spent a little over a year working as an undergraduate researcher helping with projects related to cyber-physical systems and unmanned aerial vehicles. The decision to pursue an analytics degree had its roots in a course in my third year of undergrad. In one course, we were given excerpts of real data sets accompanied by case studies from real companies. In hindsight, many of these case studies could have been solved fairly trivially by applying a simple logistic regression, but at the time our working knowledge of probability and statistics consisted of two intro courses. Being forced to creatively apply simple techniques such as simulation and hypothesis testing was one of the most fun experiences I had in a class until that point. During my last year of undergrad, I managed to get into an introductory machine learning course taught by a new faculty member. It was at this point that I realized the sheer breadth of applications in the field of analytics and data science, which motivated me to apply for the MSiA program. \r\n",

We were working on the NLSY97 dataset from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We found that married men with children typically had higher salaries than those who did not have children and were not married. I thought this was really cool! Not particularly the bias in hiring, but the fact that data analysis can reveal and highlight important information about people and society.

      "Furthermore , the program seemed to be the most established since all the programs are relatively new.\n",
      "I became interested in text analytics during a project during undergrad.\n",
      "My team and I were moved by the black lives matter movement and wanted to figure out what people were saying , what they thought about , and whether the opinions were formed in geographic or demographic pockets.\n",
      "Why was there indifference and resistance to the cause.\n",
      "We decided to tap into the Twitter API to quickly get a sense of what people were saying.\n",
      "None of us had any experience with text , beyond grep like text searches , so we took the easy way out and just looked at the trending topics every day in large cities across the US.\n",
      "If I had known more about text analytics and sentiment analysis , our project could have been much more interesting.\n",

      "I wanted to unlock the power of the information buried within those fields.\n",
      "I enjoyed a quick introduction to text analytics at my internship at an insurance company this summer.\n",
      "I built a model predicting how much the insurer would pay on commercial bodily injury claims.\n",
      "For each claim , I was provided with a full copy of claims handlers.\n",
      "notes on information about the accident.\n",
      "A data scientist at the company had written Python code that derives features from stems in the text data.\n",
      "While many of the derived features were highly predictive , I saw some areas for improvement.\n",
      "First , the code does not correct for spelling errors.\n",
      "Spelling errors are common because the claims handlers.\n",
      "notes are for internal use only ; they are never published.\n",

      "I am a big basketball fan.\n",
      "I started to play since I was in elementary school.\n",
      "I play point guard or shooting guard.\n",
      "My speed is fast and my dribbling is decent , while my stamina and strength is lower than average level.\n",
      "In the offense end , relying on my speed and dribbling , I can tear the defense easily.\n",
      "Then I can choose either layup , jump shot , or passing the ball to the open shooters.\n",
      "I used to be only able to attack from right.\n",
      "But now I can use both my left and right hand to attack.\n",
      "My shooting is not stable mainly because the size of my palm is relatively small.\n",
      "Recently , I have been developing my post-up skill , which highly rely on shooting stability and pretty hard to master.\n",
      "In the defense end , I am a versatile defender , both one-on-one defense and help defense.\n",
      "I never play hard on the people I know.\n",
      "But if a stranger hooper pissed me off , I will absolutely lock him down.\n",
      "My name is Jade.\n",
      "I am originally from China , and came to United States for high school nine years ago.\n",
      "After graduating from Georgia Tech with a major in Industrial Engineering , I worked at Deustche Bank for two years in a role of quality assurance and data analyst within global technology division.\n",
      "Everyday at DB I need to deal with large-scale raw transactions from multiple sources and ensured the accuracy and integrity.\n",
      "I started to realize the importance of data for a company and how powerful it can be if we use it properly.\n",
      "This is the reason that brought me to the field of analytics , where I could discover intelligent insights and make the most of hidden gems in massive data.\n",
      "In terms of text analytics , we had a class project where we used some preliminary methods , like removing stop word and td-idf , to process and measure sentences.\n",
      "Other that this , I don?t have much experience and therefore I certainly like to learn more.\n",
      "As we all know , unstructured information might account for more than 70 %.\n",
      "80 % of all data in organizations.\n",
      "Unlocking this potential represents a huge opportunity and the next generation of big data.\n",
      "For example , an online retailer can convert text into meaningful format to measure customer opinions , product reviews , feedback , tweets and make smart decisions.\n",
      "Besides the linguistic structure , I think all forms of human communication , such as auditory and visual structure , are significantly valuable.\n",
      "I believe this course could help me build a fundamental knowledge on how to process text data , and to derive patterns as well as to interpret the output.\n",
      "In the meantime , I would like to gain some real-world experience through different use cases.\n",
      "My future career plans primary lies on customer analytics or marketing-oriented , which stands in the front of the business line and generates revenue for the company utilizing analytical techniques.\n",
      "My name is Luyao and I 'm originally from China , although I 've been living in Los Angeles for the last 9 years.\n",
      "I came to the US for high school and went to UCLA for a B.S. in computational mathematics and statistics.\n",
      "During the program I had the opportunity to work with a professor in consulting project involving data modeling - not yet called analytics at the time - that drove my interests to applied statistics.\n",
      "Shortly after , I discovered the field that is data science and analytics that is quickly emerging as education programs at top institutions around the country , and this brought me here to MSiA.\n",
      "I worked as a quality control analyst at a clinical data processing company during the half year between college and graduate school , checking the accuracy of information extracted from clinical studies.\n",
      "Much of the information are in fact entered manually.\n",
      "someone would need to read the medical papers and organize all data into a format accepted by the company?s software platform.\n",
      "The business had troubles hiring , because people with the field expertise are either medical professionals or at the least MPH students , and these people obviously would not be satisfied by an easy office job that anyone could do if clinical studies weren?t involved.\n",
      "At the time , I wondered if it?s possible for computers to read and understand these studies , especially since much of the data are already presented in tabular form.\n",
      "That was the first time when I discovered text analytics.\n",
      "Again and again during my time in MSiA , text analysis showed up in almost every class , project , and article I read , which strengthened my will to take that on as a skill.\n",
      "In the near future I would be working as an analytics professional , hopefully at a reputable company in the tech sector.\n",
      "After some years of career growth , I may choose to return to China to be one of the leading data scientists in the country , and hopefully bring some real data science into a major corporation.\n",
      "After all , the buzzword.\n",
      "big data.\n",
      "right now really just represents beautiful infographics that deals with large static datasets.\n",
      "Since I?m now in the field directly associated to it , I will need to do some actual analysis and make people realize that it?s not just data journalism.\n"
