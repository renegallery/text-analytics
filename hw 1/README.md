# Regular expressions

A program that will take as input one plain text file and will print as output every sentence of the input file that contains a time point. Finding time points is a frequent task in text analytics. Regular expressions are well suited for this task and that is what we will use for this assignment.

A time point could be an absolute date (e.g., “October 31st, 2013” or “10/31/13”), time (e.g., “14:00 PST”), season (e.g., Spring), etc., or a relative time (e.g., “last weekend”, “now”).

The examples above exemplify that in this task, as is often the case in text analytics, problems are not well defined at the onset. In this case, what is or not a time point will depend on the actual problem one is trying to solve. For this assignment you will have to decide what patterns you want your program to capture.
